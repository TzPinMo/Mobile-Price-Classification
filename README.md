There are a lot of factors to consider when setting up a pricing strategy for a new product. Some price strategies might work for one product and some for another, depending on the market. It always helps to do some research about the market and the competitors pricing where the business is planning to launch its product.

As in our case, the price of a newly launched mobile phone can be affected by several aspects of the build and features of the phone as well as the reputation of the firm itself. Individuals are willing to pay more price to a well known brand with less features, at the same time some features can influence a customer to buy an expensive phone even from a less known brand. Our objective is to figure out a way to estimate the price of mobiles in the competitive mobile phone market, irrespective of their brand. We aim to achieve this by finding the relation between different attributes of a mobile phone (eg:- Memory, Battery, Camera megapixel etc) and its selling price, eventually predicting a price range to determine what price range can be most applicable while launching a new mobile phone.
